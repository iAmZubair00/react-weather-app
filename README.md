Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?

  [Here](https://weather-q.netlify.app/)
  
- What was your experience?

  My experience was satisfactory, there were no complications. What takes me the most time is designing the application.
  
- What have you learned/improved?

  I learned how to obtain the geolocation from the browser. I also learned to use the openweathermap.org API and be able to obtain climate data with the help of geographic coordinates and/or with the name of the cities.
  
- Your wisdom? :)

  Everything is possible with patience and creativity.
